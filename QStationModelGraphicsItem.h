/// @brief A QGraphicsItem representation of the meteorological station model.
///
/// A wind barb and text elements are rendered.
///
/// There are four text elements that appear on the plot, depicting
/// temperature, rh, pres (or height) and observation time.
///
/// Because the wind barb can be pointing in any direction, an
/// algorithm attempts to locate the text elements so that they are
/// not overdrawn by the barb.
/// The model is divided into sixteen sectors of equal angular width (22.5
/// degrees), numbered 0 through 15. The wind flag will appear in one of
/// these sectors, based on the wind direction. The text elements will be
/// rendered in four other sectors. A predefined map is used to specify,
/// for a wind flag in a given sector, the sector that each of the four
/// text elements is displayed in.
///
/// The QGraphicsItem::ItemIgnoresTransformations flag is set for
/// this graphics item, which means that the internal coordinates are
/// those of the viewport, which I believe are screen pixels. They
/// are referenced to the zero origin of the item however. setPos() is
/// used to set the position in the graphics scene.
///
/// QStationModelGraphicsItem provides context menu handling, with two entries
/// in the context menu. These actions are named process and remove, although they
/// could be used for any purpose. When they are selected from the context menu,
/// a process() or remove() signal is emitted. The default menu labels ("Process"
/// and "Remove") can be overridden in the constructor.
/// @todo Make the context menu scheme more generic. Always providing
/// a two entry context menu will not be appropriate for all applications
/// and is unnecessarily restrictive.

	/// segment. Even though the wind direction is specified in meteorological
	/// coordinates, the sectors are numbered in an increasing cartessian sense,
	/// with 0-22.5 degrees being sector 0, 22.5-45 degrees is sector 1, etc.
