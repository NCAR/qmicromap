/// @brief Render a geographical database on a QGraphicsView.
/// Certain geographical features within that a specified bounding
/// box are extracted from the database and rendered on the QGraphicsView.
/// Zooming and panning are supported. A lat/lon grid overlay may be drawn.
/// Users may add their own additional elements, such as sounding station
/// models, to the view.
///
/// Note that panning is provided automatically by QGraphicsView, responding to
/// mouse move events and scroll wheel events. This is really nice.
///
/// Three modes are defined for left mouse button interaction: zooming, panning and selection.
/// In zooming and panning modes, the mouse is used to perform these activities.
/// In selection mode, the mouse events are passed on, allowing other scene elements
/// to interact with the mouse. A right click is used to step backwards the zoom history.
///
/// The display of feature names and the grid can be toggled.
///
/// A QGraphicsScene is created and contained within QMicroMap. It is used to
/// manage the graphics elements, in keeping with the Qt Graphics View framework.
/// All drawing is accomplished by creating QGraphicsItem derived classes (e.g.
/// QGraphicsPathItem), and adding them to the QGraphicsScene. Users can access
/// the scene via QMicroMap.scene().
///
/// The Feature is the basic element that is rendered. It corresponds to one geometric
/// feature type found in the database, such as an administrative boundary, a lake,
/// a coast line, etc.
///
/// Currently the features are hardwired to those found in the Natural Earth 1m to 50m
/// shape files. See selectFeatures() for the chosen ones.
/// @todo Make the feature definitions configurable, so that alternative databases
/// can be easily swapped in.
